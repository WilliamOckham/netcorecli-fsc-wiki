# F\# and the .NET Core working together.

The .NET SDK it's language agnostic, so all tutorials should work with F# too.

Current working (stable) version:

|               | Version                    | dotnet --version        |
|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| .NET Core SDK | [preview1](http://dot.net) | `1.0.0-preview1-002702` |

The `preview1` works, but see [[.NET-Core-SDK-preview1]] for more info about issues

Supported OS: same as .NET Core SDK (win/osx/ubuntu/docker), see [download page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download#core)
