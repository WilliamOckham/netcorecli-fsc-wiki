# .NET Core SDK preview1

Use the [simpler instructions](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) but add `--lang f#` argument to `dotnet new`

Download binaries/installers for all os from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download#core

**F# works after install, without workarounds on all supported os**.

To check version, you can run

```
dotnet --version
```

and the output should be `1.0.0-preview1-002702`



An quickstart, to create a console app and run it with arguments ( "hello" etc ):

```
dotnet new --lang f#
dotnet restore
dotnet run -- hello from dotnet core
```

## Known issues

None specific to F#, works ootb on all supported os (win, osx 10.11, ubuntu 14.04, docker).

## Notes

**The released `preview1` version works OOTB** but it's better to apply the following changes to avoid issues when a new .NET SDK version is released.

The next `preview2` should not have the same problems.

### 1. Fix nugets feeds of Nuget.config

the Nuget.config contains a development feed who should be removed.

The expected Nuget.config (placed in same directory of project.json) is:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="fsharp-daily" value="https://www.myget.org/F/fsharp-daily/api/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

### 2. Pin to a compatible version of `dotnet-compile-fsc`

The `dotnet-compile-fsc` is the integration between .NET SDK (dotnet cli) and f# compiler (fsc), so must
be compatible with both.

The preferred way (atm for preview versions), is to use to a specific version `1.0.0-preview1-*` so only versions
compatible with `preview1` are considered during `dotnet restore`

The `project.json` should be changed from

```json
    "dotnet-compile-fsc": {
      "version": "1.0.0-*",
```

To

```json
    "dotnet-compile-fsc": {
      "version": "1.0.0-preview1-*",
```

### 3. Use latest release FSharp.Core compatibile with `preview1`

The `FSharp.Core` assembly (build for .NET Core) is in the `Microsoft.FSharp.Core.netcore` nuget package.
Atm the package is not released in http://nuget.org but it's in the myget development nuget 
feed `fsharp-daily` (see point 1.)

Until a version is published on nuget.org by VisualFSharp team, use the latest stable known version `1.0.0-alpha-160509`

So change the `project.json` from:

```json
    "Microsoft.FSharp.Core.netcore": "1.0.0-alpha-160316",
```

to:

```json
    "Microsoft.FSharp.Core.netcore": "1.0.0-alpha-160509",
```

Or use `1.0.0-alpha-*` if you want to use always the latest avaiable.
